# Appsessibility
## What is this?
Appsessibility is a mobile application built to support (visually impaired) mystery guests when performing audits on locations. The application is a digital version of the original questionnaire, making it easier to answer and read back the questions. It offers to first answer in one of the five standard answers, after which you can add to that, either by typing or making a voice recording.

## Important note
Although built for a client, this is, at its core, a school project built by five students. To add to that, this was our first time working with React Native. Due to this, the code quality isn't maybe too great.

## How to use?
1. Run `npm install --global expo-cli` to install the Expo command line interface.
2. Install all dependecies `npm install` used in the project.
3. Change the second import statement to `import App from '../../App/App'` in `node_modules\expo\AppEntry.js`
5. Run `expo start` to try it out.

> You can run the app in a simulator, but if you want to try it out on your own device, install Expo GO on your device. 

> For **IOS**, you can scan the QR code with the normal camera application. Click on the pop-up after scanning and it should open up our application.

> For **Android**, open up the Expo GO App and click the **Scan QR Code** button. Scan the QR code and it should automatically open up our application.
